# RestfulAPI
This project is a Flask-based API for managing drink information, allowing users to retrieve a list of drinks, access specific drink details by ID, and add new drinks to the database. It uses SQLAlchemy to interact with a SQLite database and supports JSON data format for communication. This API serves as a fundamental example for building RESTful APIs with Flask, making it a valuable foundation for more complex web service development.
